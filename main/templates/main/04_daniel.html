            Welcome to my site! My name is Daniel, I'm an electronic engineer from Colombia. I have a master's degree in electronic and computer engineering.

            During my master's I did a lot of stuff with Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR). I got involved with GPR because I love electromagnetism and its applications.
            I belong to a research team at Universidad de los Andes, directed by professor Roberto Bustamante. I first was hired for the research team as a graduate student and, when I graduated the master, I was hired as a research professional by the university.

            Our research team is small, we have had between two and four members at a time. Being a small team is great, because everyone is involved in various topics, we have to be scappy and do a wide variety of things.
            <!-- Mechanical adjustments to our equipment, simulations, coding, debugging, testing, measuring  -->

            The major highlight of our research is the development of a laboratory-grade Ground Penetrating Radar. We used a two-port Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) as the core of our radar, to each port we connected a commercial Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) antenna.
            To move our radar, we developed a position cotrolling system based on stepper motors. The position controlling system had 1 mm resolution in its steps.
            All the components were put together and controlled with a computer program we developed.
